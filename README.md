**Helix Kodit** is an **MCP server** that connects your AI coding assistant to external codebases. It can:

- Improve your AI-assisted code by providing canonical examples direct from the source
- Index local and public codebases
- Integrates with any AI coding assistant via MCP
- Search using keyword and semantic search
- Integrate with any OpenAI-compatible or custom API/model

If you're an engineer working with AI-powered coding assistants, Kodit helps by
providing relevant and up-to-date examples of your task so that LLMs make less mistakes
and produce fewer hallucinations.

## Quick Start

1. [Install Kodit](https://docs.helix.ml/kodit/#installation)
2. [Index codebases](https://docs.helix.ml/kodit/#quick-start)
3. [Integrate with your coding assistant](https://docs.helix.ml/kodit/#integrating-kodit-with-coding-assistants)

## Key Features

### Codebase Indexing

Kodit connects to a variety of local and remote codebases to build an index of your
code. This index is used to build a snippet library, ready for ingestion into an LLM.
Kodit supports indexing:

- Local directories
- Public Git repositories

### MCP Server

Relevant snippets are exposed to an AI coding assistant via an MCP server. This allows
the assistant to request relevant snippets by providing keywords, code, and semantic
intent. Kodit has been tested to work well with:

- [Cursor](https://docs.helix.ml/kodit/#integration-with-cursor)
- [Cline](https://docs.helix.ml/kodit/#integration-with-cline)
- Please contribute more instructions!
- ... any other assistant is likely to work ...

### Enterprise Ready

Out of the box, Kodit works with a local SQLite database and very small, local models.
But enterprises can scale out with performant databases and dedicated models. Everything
can even run securely, privately, with on-premise LLM platforms like
[Helix](https://helix.ml).

Supported databases:

- SQLite
- [Vectorchord](https://github.com/tensorchord/VectorChord)

Supported providers:

- Local (which uses tiny CPU-only open-source models)
- OpenAI
- Any other OpenAI compatible API
