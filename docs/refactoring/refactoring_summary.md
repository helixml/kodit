# Refactoring Summary: IndexingApplicationService & SnippetApplicationService

## Completed Work

### Phase 1: Preparation & Analysis ✅

- Ran baseline tests (all 17 passing)
- Documented current API surface
- Analyzed dependencies (CLI, MCP, factories)

### Phase 2: Create Domain Layer Foundation ✅

- Created `SnippetDomainService` to consolidate snippet operations at domain level
- Created factory for the domain service
- Created comprehensive unit tests (all 8 passing)

### Phase 3: Create Unified Application Service ✅

- Created `CodeIndexingApplicationService` that unifies all operations
- Created factory for the unified service
- Key improvements:
  - Single transaction boundary per operation
  - No circular dependencies
  - Consistent command/query pattern
  - Clear separation of concerns

### Phase 4: Create Adapter Layer ✅

- Created `IndexingApplicationServiceAdapter` for backward compatibility
- Created `SnippetApplicationServiceAdapter` for backward compatibility  
- Updated factories to return adapters wrapping the unified service
- All existing tests pass without modification

## Architecture Improvements

### Before

```
IndexingApplicationService ──depends on──> SnippetApplicationService
     ↓                                            ↓
Domain Services                           Domain Services
```

### After

```
CodeIndexingApplicationService
     ├── IndexingDomainService
     ├── SnippetDomainService
     ├── BM25DomainService
     ├── EmbeddingDomainService
     └── EnrichmentDomainService
```

## Next Steps (Phase 5: Migration)

### 1. Update CLI (`src/kodit/cli.py`)

Replace:

```python
snippet_service = create_snippet_application_service(session)
indexing_service = create_indexing_application_service(...)
```

With:

```python
unified_service = create_code_indexing_application_service(...)
```

### 2. Update MCP Server (`src/kodit/mcp.py`)

Similar updates to use the unified service directly.

### 3. Update Tests

Migrate tests to use `CodeIndexingApplicationService` directly.

### 4. Remove Old Code (Phase 6)

- Remove original `IndexingApplicationService` and `SnippetApplicationService`
- Remove the adapters
- Clean up factories

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Better Cohesion**: All indexing operations in one service
2. **Clear Transactions**: Single commit per operation
3. **No Circular Dependencies**: Clean dependency graph
4. **Improved Testability**: Domain logic separated from orchestration
5. **Backward Compatible**: Zero breaking changes during migration

## Risk Assessment

- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ No API changes for consumers
- ✅ Gradual migration possible
- ✅ Easy rollback if needed
